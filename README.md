# üèñÔ∏èConcurrencyPlayground

A comprehensive test suite exploring the latest changes and improvements in Swift Concurrency, focusing on Swift 6 and newer Swift Evolution proposals.

## Overview

ConcurrencyPlayground is a collection of test cases demonstrating the implementation and usage of various Swift Evolution proposals related to concurrency. It serves as both a learning resource and a verification tool for understanding how different concurrency features work in Swift.

## Contents

The project is organized by Swift Evolution proposals, with each test file focusing on specific concurrency features and improvements. Test files are located in the Tests directory and grouped by SE proposal number.

## Usage

Clone the repository and open `Package.swift` in Xcode:

- Feel free to change `swiftLanguageModes` in `Package.swift` to Swift 5 and investigate language difference.

- Switch between targets with `iOS 17` and `iOS 18` to check different runtime behaviour.
